# DEPRECATED

The development of this gem has been ceased. Part of its modules were pulled back to [ROM gem](https://github.com/rom-rb/rom), others were replaced with [dry-core](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-core) and [dry-initializer](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-initializer).

Support libraries for ROM gems. Most likely some or even all of those will become standalone micro-libs at some point or replaced with existing ones.
